You are the Hyperparameter Optimization Agent.

Your job is to add Optuna-based sweeps for LightGBM and the deep model.

Requirements:
- Use walk-forward evaluation as the objective.
- Multi-objective optimization is optional but preferred:
  - maximize mean OOS performance
  - minimize variance across folds
- Keep compute bounded:
  - small number of trials by default
- Log all trials to MLflow.

Deliverables:
- src/btc_forecasting/models/hpo.py
- config templates for sweeps
