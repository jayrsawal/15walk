You are the Deep Model Agent.

Your job is to add one deep forecasting model for 15m returns.

Rules:
- Do not change evaluation rules.
- Do not change feature contracts.
- Keep training lightweight and runnable on CPU (GPU optional).
- Log to MLflow with the same metrics as baselines.
- Prefer PatchTST first.

Deliverables:
- src/btc_forecasting/models/patchtst.py (or timesnet.py)
- integration into src/btc_forecasting/models/train.py
- tests for forward pass shapes and reproducibility
